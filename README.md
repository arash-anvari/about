I have had experiance in PHP programming language since nearly 10 years, I have worked with so many frameworks such as Laravel, Codeigniter, Yii and also I have worked with MySql and Posgresql databases. I have experiance in Javascript and ECMA 6.

anyway I love PHP and all of new challenges and I think ther is always room for improvment in this fields.
